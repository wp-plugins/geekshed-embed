== Description ==

GeekShed Embed allows a user to easily embed a [GeekShed IRC](http://geekshed.net) channel (chat room) onto their website. In additions to creating it via the options page, there are also two shortcodes that allow for use in page and/or post. Two other shortcodes are also included; one will display a list of users currently in the room, and the other will display a small userbadge with the number of chatters in the room.
